# Medicine Recommendation System
The Medicine Recommendation System (MRS) has undergone significant evolution, leveraging advancements in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and diverse technologies. This paper presents an approach utilizing Large Language Models to enhance the system's personalization and context-awareness by the introduction of Smart Disease Diagnosis mechanism which leverage the intelligence of LLMs to diagnose the disease suffered by the user by asking counter-questions for effective diagnosis. The introduction of the diagnosis module powered by LLM to existing Medicine Recommendation Systems has proven to increase the effectiveness by a factor of 25% in medicine recommendations. Utilization of Knowledge graphs makes the system provide tailored recommendations to users by capturing intricate semantic relationships between medicines, diseases, and symptoms, thereby augmenting the accuracy and relevance of medical suggestions. Moreover, the system demonstrates the significance of Diagnosis Module in existing Medicine recommendation system for enhanced efficiency, robustness and reliability of recommendations. In a nutshell, the project showcases the innovative utilization of cutting-edge technologies like LLM to revolutionize medical recommendation systems, emphasizing their potential to optimize healthcare delivery and improve patient outcomes.
